# GobboTracker
GobboTracker is an application intended to assist a Game Master in a TableTop RPG. Since I play Dungeons and Dragons, I am primarily developing it for that, but with flexibility for homebrew modifications. This flexibility should allow one to be able to adapt this application for other RPG's as well. 

# Development information
* This is a GTK application written in C, that I am primarily developing on my Debian Linux PC. However, I intend to also make it work on Mac, and will look into getting it to run on Windows. 

* As I am not targeting any esoteric or obscure operating system or compiler, making a program with a particularly complex file structure, or writing a library, rather than use pre-processor include guards, I am using the `pragma once directive`.
